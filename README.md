Python 3 code for "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications" by David Vallado

My overall aims for this repository are to:

  1) re-create David Vallado's algorithms in Python 3, vectorized where possible
  2) learn how to develop Python 3 packages
  3) become a better Python programmer
  
In order to achieve these aims, I welcome any and all constructive feedback!
